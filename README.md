# network-gui
A GUI for simulating networks of neurons (requires Matlab or Matlab Runtime)

Ideally, installing Matlab Runtime and running GUI.exe will load a standalone application with the GUI. However, Matlab Runtime can be hard to work with, so the code can now be downloaded and just run in Matlab.
documentation.pdf provides more details about the simulations
splash.PNG is for a splash screen, but it is not at all necessary
